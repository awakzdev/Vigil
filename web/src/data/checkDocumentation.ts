    whatWeCheck:
      "In each VPC, AWS creates a security group named default. Vigil flags that group when it has any inbound or outbound rules. An empty default SG (no custom rules) is what we treat as passing.",
    whyShown:
      "This is not saying your instances are wide open right now. It means: if someone launches a resource without choosing a security group, AWS attaches the default SG — and any rules on it become that resource's firewall. CIS and SOC 2 expect the default SG to stay empty so accidental launches do not inherit permissive rules.",
    overview: {
      context:
        "Every VPC has a default security group. AWS auto-attaches it to ENIs/instances when no other SG is specified at launch.",
      exposure:
        "Custom rules on the default SG apply to anything that lands on it by mistake — a common source of 'we thought it was locked down' gaps.",
      fix:
        "Remove inbound/outbound rules from each VPC's default SG; put real rules on named security groups and attach those explicitly to workloads.",

  "iam.role.external_account_trust": {
    whatWeCheck:
      "We read each IAM role's trust policy (AssumeRolePolicyDocument). If an Allow statement grants sts:AssumeRole to a principal in another AWS account (12-digit account ID ≠ yours), we open a finding. VigilReadOnly and trust limited to your Vigil scan principal are excluded.",
    whyShown:
      "Cross-account role trust is how vendors, partners, or compromised third parties access your account. It is mapped to SOC 2 external-access controls — not a CIS line item. Expected integrations (e.g. your read-only scan role) should not appear after a re-scan.",
    overview: {
      context:
        "The trust policy defines who may assume the role. External account IDs in Principal.AWS are intentional cross-account access paths.",
      exposure:
        "A role assumed from outside your account can use every permission attached to that role until trust or policies are tightened.",
      fix:
        "Confirm each external account is approved; remove stale principals or add ExternalId / condition keys to narrow assumption.",

  "iam.root.no_mfa": {
    whatWeCheck:
      "We read the root user's MFA status from IAM. If no virtual or hardware MFA device is assigned, we open this finding.",
    whyShown:
      "Root credentials bypass normal IAM boundaries. SOC 2 and CIS require MFA on the root account because a single compromised password grants full account control.",
    overview: {
      context: "The AWS account root user is the ultimate break-glass identity.",
      exposure: "Without MFA, a leaked root password alone is sufficient for full account takeover.",
      fix: "Sign in as root → Security credentials → assign a hardware MFA device (virtual MFA is discouraged for root).",
    },
  },
  "iam.user.no_mfa": {
    whatWeCheck:
      "For IAM users with console access enabled, we verify MFA is assigned on the user (virtual or hardware device). No MFA on console-capable users → finding.",
    whyShown:
      "Password-only console sign-in fails most SOC 2 / CIS identity controls. This check is about requiring a second factor for console login — not deleting the user or removing access keys.",
    overview: {
      context:
        "Console users without MFA can be fully compromised with a stolen password alone.",
      exposure:
        "Phished or leaked passwords grant interactive AWS Console access until MFA is enforced.",
      fix:
        "Assign an MFA device on the user's Security credentials tab. Access keys are unchanged until you rotate them separately.",

  "iam.policy.unattached": {

      "We list customer-managed IAM policies in your account and flag any with zero attachments to users, groups, or roles.",
